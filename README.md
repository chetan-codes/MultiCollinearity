# Multicollinearity Detection in Python

## Overview
This repository focuses on detecting multicollinearity in linear regression models using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) in Python. Multicollinearity occurs when independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated, leading to inaccurate and unstable estimates of the coefficients.

## Introduction
Multicollinearity can significantly impact the reliability of regression analysis results. In this project, we utilize OLS regression to identify multicollinearity and explore techniques to address it, ensuring robust and accurate model predictions.

## Contents
- `MulticollinearityWithOLS.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for detecting and addressing multicollinearity using OLS regression.
- `data.csv`: CSV file containing sample dataset for multicollinearity analysis.

## Approach
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to identify potential multicollinearity issues.
2. **Multicollinearity Detection**: Implement OLS regression and examine variance inflation factors (VIF) to detect multicollinearity.
3. **Addressing Multicollinearity**: Explore techniques such as feature selection, dimensionality reduction, or regularization to mitigate multicollinearity effects.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the impact of multicollinearity on model performance and compare different approaches for handling it.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Statsmodels
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open and run the `MulticollinearityWithOLS.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.

## Results
By addressing multicollinearity, we can improve the stability and accuracy of linear regression models, leading to more reliable predictions and better insights into the relationships between independent variables.
